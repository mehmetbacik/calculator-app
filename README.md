# Calculator App

Calculator-App project is a web application where users can perform simple and advanced mathematical calculations. The app supports the basic four operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. There are three different theme options that users can switch between. React.js and TypeScript were used in the project. Tailwind CSS and SCSS were used for interface design.

## Technologies:

- **React.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces in a declarative and efficient manner.

- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language.

- **SCSS:** A more powerful and feature-rich extension of CSS that enables better organization and maintainability of stylesheets.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces, providing low-level utility classes that can be composed to create any design directly in HTML markup.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
